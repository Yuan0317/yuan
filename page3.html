        <div class="description">
          Possessing the fundamentals of logic, problem-solving and programming
          language structure provides a solid foundation for further study in
          the field. Students develop introductory knowledge of computer
          programming with emphasis on problem analysis and design, using
          algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts, UML Class Diagrams and testing,
          with the Java programming language used as a means to implement
          problem solution designs. Through an introduction to the Java
          programming language students use sequential structures, selection
          structures, repetition structures, variables, constants, methods,
          constructors, one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming,
          classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, inputs, outputs, coding
          conventions and documentation. Theory is reinforced with application
          by means of practical laboratory assessments.

          Maintaining a computer, using operating system and productivity
          software, and expressing related environmental and sustainability
          concerns, is an important part of working with Information Technology.
          Students explain computer hardware, and use operating system software
          to maintain, utilize, and secure a computer. Students practice the use
          of spreadsheet software to solve problems, use formulas, and visualize
          data with charts. Students discuss computer hardware and software with
          regards to financial and environmental sustainability. Theory is
          reinforced with application by means of practical laboratory
          assessments, including using virtualization software to install guest
          operating systems onto a host computer.

        <div class="level">level 1</div>
        <div class="description">
          Databases are used to store data and are a core component of many
          information technology systems. Students learn the fundamentals of
          relational databases design using Entity Relation Diagrams (ERDs), and
          use Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, modify and query a
          database. Students design and create databases that are maintainable,
          secure and adaptable to change in business requirements, using
          normalization. Students become familiar with the functions of a
          Database Management System (DBMS) and its components in comparison
          with legacy systems and alternative information storage mechanisms.

        <div class="description">
          The World Wide Web (WWW) has become an integrated part of everyday
          life. Students develop basic skills of web programming, website design
          and implementation. JavaScript, HTML5, and PHP are used to explore
          web-based solutions to problems of increasing interactivity and
          complexity. Lectures are reinforced by practical assignments that
          encourage students to construct and maintain their own websites.

        <div class="level">level 2</div>
        <div class="description">
          Working in the field of information technology as a programmer
          requires a firm understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
          concepts. Students explore object-oriented programming methodology
          using the Java programming language. Object oriented concepts, such as
          encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism are covered
          and reinforced with practical applications. Students explore the
          basics of data structures and algorithms as well as basic Graphical
          User Interface (GUI) programming.

        <div class="description">
          Operating systems form the backbone of information technology systems
          coordinating the interaction between hardware and software. Students
          explore the basic concepts and components of Operating Systems (OS),
          and how they function and interact with hardware and software
          components. Students examine the details of operating system
          structures, process management, storage management, installation,
          configuration, and administration both in theory and through practical
          assignments based on the GNU/Linux operating system. Lab work is
          designed to implement the theory by developing skills using the
          powerful GNU/Linux command-line tools and utilities.
